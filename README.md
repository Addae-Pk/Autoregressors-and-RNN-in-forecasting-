# Times-series-forecasting-

 A projet of a quarterly projection on "USA GDP Forecasting‚Äù. Presents a meticulous analysis and  Gross Domestic Product over the three years (thus 12 quarters).


# Univariate forecasting

 Employing the ARIMA model. Box-Jenkins approach is applied to estimate the ARIMA model, accompanied by an exploration of potential causal variables influencing GDP


# Multivariate forecasting 
 
Inevstigating Vector AutoRegressive with exogenous variables (VAR-X) model and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). Plus, rigorously testing at least 10 exogenous factors, and executing model estimation and validation.


# Neural Networks for forecasting 

RNN/LSTM architecutre : trying to unleash of Machine Learning on times series (non-linear relationships, etc)
