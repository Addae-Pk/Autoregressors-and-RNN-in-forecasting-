## ARIMA, VAR-X, VECM and RNN for times series forecasting 

 A projet of a quarterly projection on "USA GDP Forecasting‚Äù. Presents a meticulous analysis and  Gross Domestic Product over the three years (thus 12 quarters).

#### _Requirements_
This assignement required initialising the reticulate package converts the Python objects to R. As needed on the backend to run TensorFlow and Keras. 


### Preprocess
feature selection
model selection
optimal order 

### Univariate ARIMA

Employing the ARIMA model & Box-Jenkins approach to estimate the ARIMA model, accompanied by an exploration of potential causal variables influencing GDP


### Multivariate
 
Inevstigating Vector AutoRegressive with exogenous variables (VAR-X) model and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). Plus, rigorously testing at least 10 exogenous factors, and executing model estimation and validation.


### Neural Networks
RNN/LSTM architecutre : trying to unleash of Machine Learning on times series (non-linear temporal dependencies, etc)
Model's implentation used  Tensorflow dependencies package & Keras. Offers the sequential API framework to create models based on instances through a sequential() class, allowing very low-level of APIs and computational time for training
