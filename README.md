## ARIMA, VAR-X, VECM and RNN for times series forecasting 

 A projet of a quarterly projection on "USA GDP Forecasting‚Äù. Presents a meticulous analysis and  Gross Domestic Product over the three years (thus 12 quarters).

#### _Requirements_
This assignement required initialising the reticulate package converts the Python objects to R. As needed on the backend to run TensorFlow and Keras. 


### Univariate forecasting

 Employing the ARIMA model. Box-Jenkins approach is applied to estimate the ARIMA model, accompanied by an exploration of potential causal variables influencing GDP


### Multivariate forecasting 
 
Inevstigating Vector AutoRegressive with exogenous variables (VAR-X) model and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). Plus, rigorously testing at least 10 exogenous factors, and executing model estimation and validation.


### Neural Networks for forecasting 
RNN/LSTM architecutre : trying to unleash of Machine Learning on times series (non-linear temporal dependencies, etc)

To build our model, we used the Tensorflow dependencies package, Keras, that offer the sequential API framework which creates models based on instances through a sequential() class, allowing very low-level of APIs and computational time for trainin
